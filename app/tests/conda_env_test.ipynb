      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight enters our atmosphere, it consists of a spectrum of colors, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\n",
      "2. **Light travels through the atmosphere**: As light travels through the air, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).\n",
      "3. **Scattering occurs**: These small gas molecules scatter the shorter wavelengths of light, like blue and violet, more than the longer wavelengths, like red and orange. This is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n",
      "4. **Blue light is scattered in all directions**: The scattered blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere in all directions, giving the sky its blue color.\n",
      "5. **The Earth's atmosphere scatters even more blue light**: As a result of this scattering, the blue light is also reflected back towards our eyes by the entire atmosphere, making it appear as though the sky is blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "This effect is most pronounced when the sun is high in the sky and the atmosphere is calm, allowing the blue light to be scattered extensively. During sunrise and sunset, the angle of the sunlight changes, and the shorter wavelengths are more efficiently scattered, giving the sky a reddish or orange hue.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the sky appears blue because of Rayleigh scattering, which scatters shorter wavelengths of light (like blue) in all directions and reflects them back to our eyes, creating the blue color we see during the day.\n"

      "Zulin agreed, and he and the princess set out on their journey together. Along the way, they encountered many obstacles, including monsters and dark magic. But Zulin and the princess were determined to succeed, and they fought bravely against the evil forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, after many months of travel, they reached the sorcerer's castle. The sorcerer was a gruff and powerful man, with a face like a storm cloud and eyes as black as coal. He challenged Zulin and the princess to a battle, and they fought fiercely.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, Zulin and the princess emerged victorious. The sorcerer was defeated, and his power was broken. The princess was saved, and Zulin was hailed as a hero.\n",
